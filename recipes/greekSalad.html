    <h1>Greek Salad Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/greekSalad.png" alt="Image Greek Salad">

    <p>This Greek salad dressing is the "secret recipe" from the pizzeria I work at. It's the best dressing I have ever tasted! People offer to buy it constantly, but if we sold it, we wouldn't be able to make enough for the restaurant! This recipe makes almost a gallon, but see the note below the recipe if you want to make a smaller amount.</p>
